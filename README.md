# Movies Dataset Analysis

Movies are one of the most popular forms of entertainment, as a person who enjoys a good film on a weekend night, I wanted to explore and analyze data on films and film industry.

I obtained the dataset for this analysis from The Movie Database (TMDb) which contains 10,866 rows and 21 columns of movie data. The dataset contains features such as movie popularity, genres, film director and production companies. 

In this project, I applied data science and data analysis techniques to answer the following questions:
* What are the most frequent movie genres?
* Who are the most casted actors?
* What is the distribution of profits for the top 10 most popular movies?

## Libraries used

* Python 
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
