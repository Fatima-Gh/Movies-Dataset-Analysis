# Movies Dataset Analysis

In this project, I applied data science and data analysis techniques to answer the following questions:
* What are the most frequent movie genres?
* Who are the most casted actors?
* What is the distribution of profits for the top 10 most popular movies?

## Libraries used

* Python 
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
